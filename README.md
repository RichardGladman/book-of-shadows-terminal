# Book of Shadows Terminal Edition

This isn't intended to be a feature complete program it was intended to practice C++, use sqlite3, and get a few ideas solidified in my head. It turned into a horrible mix of Java techniques (which I'm used to) and C++ techniques (which I'm not).

It's a basic attempt at a book of shadows, logging runes, tarot cards and their correspondences.

If you are interested, you build it by building and installing [ansicodes](https://github.com/RichardGladman/ansicodes) and then cloning it then changing into the project directory and running the following commands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

And then you run it by running ./bookofshadows

It was written and tested on Linux and uses terminal ansi codes, so it may give funky output in Windows.
